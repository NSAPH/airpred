# NSAPH Air Pollution Prediction Code

This project is a python implementation of Qian Di's air pollution prediction model.

## Git Development Structure

All new branches should be branched off of the `test` branch. Each branch off of that should be focused on implementing
one specific feature for the overall program. Features should be developed and tested in their individual branches, then
merged into `test` for integrated testing. If all merged features in `test` are functioning together, then `test` can be
merged into `master`.
